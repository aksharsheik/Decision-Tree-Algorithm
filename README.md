# 🌳 Decision Tree Classification Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Decision Tree Classification** algorithm using Python.  
The objective is to understand how decision trees work, how data is split based on conditions, and how predictions are made for classification problems.
Decision Trees are simple yet powerful machine learning algorithms widely used for **classification and regression** tasks because of their interpretability and ease of use.
